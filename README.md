### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- For my final project, I needed to implement a temperature sensor using a CC3220S-launchxl micorocontroller from Texas Instruments. The board and software would be used for a smart thermostat. With the board set up and the software implemented, it allowed me to set a temperature. Once the ambient temperature from the boards temperature sensor exceeded the set point, the LED would turn off. If the current temp dropped below the set point, the LED would turn back on signifying that the heat was turning back on. Using the buttons on the side of the board, I could adjust the set point for the temperature. 
### What did you do particularly well?
- The section that I did particularly well was implementing the led to turn on and off when the boards temperature setting was greater than or equal to the set point.
### Where could you improve?
- There is always room for improvement and ways to become better at a systems architecture. Searching and finding the best way to create interrupts and implementing them with timers is a needed and is a desired skill for me.
### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
