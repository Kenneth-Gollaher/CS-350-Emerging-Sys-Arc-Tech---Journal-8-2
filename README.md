### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- For my final project, I needed to implement a temperature sensor using a CC3220S-launchxl micorocontroller from Texas Instruments. The board and software would be used for a smart thermostat. With the board set up and the software implemented, it allowed me to set a temperature. Once the ambient temperature from the boards temperature sensor exceeded the set point, the LED would turn off. If the current temp dropped below the set point, the LED would turn back on signifying that the heat was turning back on. Using the buttons on the side of the board, I could adjust the set point for the temperature. 
### What did you do particularly well?
- The section that I did particularly well was implementing the led to turn on and off when the boards temperature setting was greater than or equal to the set point.
### Where could you improve?
- There is always room for improvement and ways to become better at a systems architecture. Searching and finding the best way to create interrupts and implementing them with timers is a needed and is a desired skill for me.
### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The resources that I am striving to add to my support network is an application implementing IoT to a smart device. I would like to gain more knowledge and strive to gether more resources to make myself proficient at that skill of development.
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- Throughout the entire course, I gained skills that can be transferable to other projects. This particular project helped me with implementing callbacks and enable interrupts. 
### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- The success for any application is to write and modify code so that it is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. It is crucial to not make the code and documentation so vague that it is hard to read. This may cause code maintenance to become difficult for you as well as other developers. Within this project, I made my documentation clear and consise. I used the proper coding standards on the lines of code as well as the documentation. I believe my project is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
